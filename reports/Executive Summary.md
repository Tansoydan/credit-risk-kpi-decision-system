# Executive Summary

## Objective
Build a data-driven credit approval framework that balances growth and risk using loan-level PD estimates.

## Data
- ~1.35M historical loans
- Issue dates: 2007–2018
- Observed outcomes only (Fully Paid vs Default / Charged Off)

## Key Findings
- Default rate rises from ~6% (Grade A) to ~50% (Grade G)
- PD model achieves ~0.70 ROC-AUC on out-of-sample vintages
- PD-based thresholds offer smoother control of risk vs approval rate than grade cut-offs

## Recommendation
Use PD-based approval thresholds rather than coarse grade rules to:
- improve capital efficiency
- allow controlled expansion during growth phases
- apply consistent risk limits across borrower profiles
